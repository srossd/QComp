QComp
=====

This library depends on:
- JAMA, a matrix library developed by [NIST](http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/) 
- StdDraw, a graphics library from [Princeton](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/)

A simple illustration of its use is provided in `test/Test.java`. A more complicated circuit, a 3-bit adder, is implemented in `test/AdderTest.java`.
